Evan Galt
I am on the road right now, but we I think what we talked about last time was ideally viewing just going through from top to bottom, looking at the tool and and seeing if there's anything else we wanna change or if everything is in the right place.
0:2:17.430 --> 0:2:26.160
Evan Galt
We were targeting today for all of the flow sheet rows to be available as well and so probably spend however long that takes.
0:2:26.170 --> 0:2:27.310
Evan Galt
But you know, it takes a whole meeting.
0:2:27.320 --> 0:2:33.280
Evan Galt
That's fine, but spend the first half the meeting on that and then talk about the training plan.
0:2:34.290 --> 0:2:35.620
Evan Galt
So what does that look like?
0:2:35.630 --> 0:2:42.10
Evan Galt
Do we wanna just start with tip sheets or do we wanna try to do a video or do some other options?
0:2:43.410 --> 0:2:44.950
Evan Galt
Does that sound OK, everybody, everybody.
0:2:48.120 --> 0:2:48.690
Evan Galt
And I don't know.
0:2:48.700 --> 0:2:49.210
Evan Galt
I saw that.
0:2:49.280 --> 0:2:50.190
Evan Galt
Do we have money on?
0:2:50.660 --> 0:2:51.90
Evan Galt
I saw that.
0:2:51.70 --> 0:2:51.550
Craig Glazer
I think so.
0:2:51.100 --> 0:2:53.0
Evan Galt
Monty, you're here.
0:2:52.510 --> 0:2:53.110
Craig Glazer
Yeah, monty's.
0:2:53.10 --> 0:2:53.210
Evan Galt
Money.
0:2:53.970 --> 0:2:54.350
Evan Galt
OK, cool.
0:2:56.120 --> 0:2:56.560
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I'm here.
0:2:57.570 --> 0:3:1.320
Evan Galt
Do we wanna just start with that and review the tool and see how everything looks?
0:3:6.370 --> 0:3:6.570
Craig Glazer
Sure.
0:3:24.890 --> 0:3:29.90
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
OK, I wasn't in the last couple of meetings.
0:3:32.230 --> 0:3:48.290
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So I Griselda had advised that we wanted to move this up to the top since we do have this functional now so that we could see that at a glance after we've looked at the header here.
0:3:48.500 --> 0:3:51.380
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Of course, this would be the button to update this if we needed to.
0:3:52.940 --> 0:3:54.320
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
You've got insurance.
0:3:54.410 --> 0:3:58.370
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
We've got the discharge.
0:3:58.380 --> 0:4:5.110
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
This physician, patient family medical progression that we've already had and reviewed these items are the same.
0:4:5.600 --> 0:4:16.590
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
We've been working on is adding these sections here for the Care Coordination widget.
0:4:17.410 --> 0:4:26.980
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Ohh I don't have quite all of them in there yet, but I've got enough here so that you can see the concept of it.
0:4:27.70 --> 0:4:30.80
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I can have the others done by the end of the day.
0:4:30.90 --> 0:4:45.800
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Tomorrow I can clean up so some of the spacing isn't here, but the way this works is if they're going to be doing DME for example, they can click that and I will expand down the list of questions from the flowsheet rows that Elma have provided.
0:4:47.950 --> 0:4:59.490
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Now, if we say no, we wanted some color coding so that would be red and green and black.
0:4:59.660 --> 0:5:3.210
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I'm trying to figure out how I can make some of those things green.
0:5:3.560 --> 0:5:6.0
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I can make them display red.
0:5:8.630 --> 0:5:17.870
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
On the tool here so that we know we've still got something pending here to do ohm, but if we answer the the questions through here.
0:5:21.950 --> 0:5:23.20
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I just hope it works.
0:5:23.30 --> 0:5:24.720
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I need to follow up pending.
0:5:34.550 --> 0:5:34.600
Craig Glazer
O.
0:5:36.130 --> 0:5:43.960
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
This is pretty much what it would look like until we go back in there and change the answers on some of those things and then they would be black.
0:5:57.380 --> 0:5:59.90
Craig Glazer
It Deb for like for those things.
0:5:59.100 --> 0:6:4.260
Craig Glazer
How many of those of that stuff is sequential steps versus stuff that's being worked concurrently?
0:6:9.640 --> 0:6:10.220
Debra Warrington
Good question.
0:6:10.230 --> 0:6:18.160
Debra Warrington
I was just looking the Amie additional paperwork signed ohm that's probably.
0:6:20.830 --> 0:6:24.920
Debra Warrington
Ah well, the documentation is built into our order as a rule.
0:6:30.660 --> 0:6:34.820
Debra Warrington
Yeah, I there's a number of these things that were not included in our steps.
0:6:37.240 --> 0:6:37.770
Debra Warrington
So I don't know.
0:6:40.390 --> 0:6:41.340
Craig Glazer
So why don't we start there?
0:6:41.350 --> 0:6:43.520
Craig Glazer
Why is there stuff here that's not in this steps?
0:6:46.580 --> 0:6:47.850
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I'm going off of what?
0:6:47.860 --> 0:6:54.950
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Elma sent me here from the spreadsheet, and for example, do you mean these were the things to be included?
0:6:55.440 --> 0:7:3.80
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So that's why we have those things on there from the information that Elma provided after she worked with Deborah and her team.
0:7:7.40 --> 0:7:16.830
Elma Mendes
So Deborah, this is this is probably something that you know, seeing it for the very first time how it's built out might not make sense right away.
0:7:16.840 --> 0:7:20.650
Elma Mendes
But if you remember these DME additions that were needed.
0:7:21.590 --> 0:7:29.190
Elma Mendes
Umm is is what was part of that spreadsheet that we wanted to add now?
0:7:29.860 --> 0:7:32.460
Elma Mendes
Maybe we can fix up some of these workflows yet?
0:7:33.990 --> 0:7:38.470
Elma Mendes
Umm, you know, this could be a, you know, still something that we were gonna work on.
0:7:39.280 --> 0:7:46.580
Elma Mendes
Like for instance, the DME additions need a could be maybe cascade off of some question instead of always being there.
0:7:47.850 --> 0:7:53.950
Debra Warrington
Yeah, because a lot of those are not gonna be indicated for every single DMA aid.
0:7:57.150 --> 0:7:58.300
Debra Warrington
Yeah, it just caught me off guard.
0:8:0.780 --> 0:8:1.30
Elma Mendes
Yeah.
0:8:1.40 --> 0:8:14.330
Elma Mendes
So I'm sure that this is gonna need some tweaking and you know viewing it for the very first time with a bigger group is, you know, it's probably not when we should.
0:8:14.640 --> 0:8:21.230
Elma Mendes
You know, we should probably look at it and and review it carefully so that it makes sense.
0:8:21.270 --> 0:8:22.320
Elma Mendes
We can make some tweaks.
0:8:23.110 --> 0:8:23.370
Debra Warrington
OK.
0:8:25.480 --> 0:8:27.830
Craig Glazer
Can we see some of the other things besides DME, Monty.
0:8:29.960 --> 0:8:30.320
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Sure.
0:8:32.50 --> 0:8:32.710
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Ohm.
0:8:36.200 --> 0:8:36.930
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Two feeding.
0:8:43.400 --> 0:8:47.550
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
These are the questions that were in the PowerPoint for two feeding.
0:8:47.560 --> 0:8:56.220
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So if we say that the arguments in place to feeding orders pending, let's just play.
0:8:56.230 --> 0:9:3.20
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
The referral is spending less to say, deepening agency, except that it's pending.
0:9:13.950 --> 0:9:14.570
Craig Glazer
Yeah, I can.
0:9:15.620 --> 0:9:23.470
Craig Glazer
I mean, I can give you my opinion, but obviously I think we need to hear from everyone, but it's too long is my opinion.
0:9:24.540 --> 0:9:32.610
Craig Glazer
I think we need to find a way to collapse these into steps and that way we can see if the step is completed because this is a little to me.
0:9:32.670 --> 0:9:43.520
Craig Glazer
It's a little too much sausage making into terms of this, things that Debs needs for each of these things, so it's important maybe to capture for them, but not necessarily important for the whole team, right?
0:9:46.590 --> 0:9:46.920
Debra Warrington
Agree.
0:9:49.670 --> 0:9:49.880
Jennifer Thibodeau
Agree.
0:9:52.80 --> 0:9:52.460
Marilyn Pitts
I agree.
0:9:55.140 --> 0:9:58.280
Craig Glazer
I looking at this, I mean, I think there's categories here, right?
0:9:59.690 --> 0:10:10.700
Craig Glazer
There's the paperwork category, which is the order and the agency and referral, there's the payment category, which is your insurance and the patient out of pocket costs.
0:10:11.750 --> 0:10:27.570
Craig Glazer
There's the teaching and the supplies at the I mean, maybe not even, maybe even that's more than we need, but I think we need to find a way to take these 10 or 15 things and collapse them down into smaller groups that we can say this parts done this parts done.
0:10:27.580 --> 0:10:28.510
Craig Glazer
This part's not done.
0:10:28.520 --> 0:10:33.140
Craig Glazer
And then at the end you can just show that once you complete, that's all you need to see is the complete.
0:10:42.20 --> 0:10:43.230
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
OK O.
0:10:43.360 --> 0:10:43.730
Craig Glazer
It's.
0:10:44.160 --> 0:10:53.660
Craig Glazer
Yeah, maybe you can get with Alma on on that and with your team and kind of figure out how can we kind of bucket this stuff a little better.
0:10:53.670 --> 0:11:0.240
Craig Glazer
So that what actually displays in the tool is not the many steps within a bigger step.
0:11:1.710 --> 0:11:1.990
Debra Warrington
Sure.
0:11:4.600 --> 0:11:6.600
Craig Glazer
Like show us like a get.
0:11:6.640 --> 0:11:11.580
Craig Glazer
Can you clear all that easily, Monty, or are we gonna have the same problem you had before that we needed to use the other format.
0:11:13.570 --> 0:11:14.280
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Ohm.
0:11:14.290 --> 0:11:18.830
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah, you with flowsheet you can't clear that out, but I can open another patient.
0:11:31.50 --> 0:11:32.600
Craig Glazer
How often do these things change?
0:11:32.610 --> 0:11:34.60
Craig Glazer
Partway through hospitalization, them.
0:11:38.160 --> 0:11:39.870
Debra Warrington
Probably more often than you'd think, honestly.
0:11:40.550 --> 0:11:42.600
Craig Glazer
Yeah, that's what I was expecting you to say.
0:11:42.610 --> 0:12:3.230
Craig Glazer
So money, I mean, I think let's get it cleaned up so that we know what we want it to look like, but we may need to look at the other format for this so that we have the flexibility to make changes and last step, you're gonna say that this is gonna be filled out by your team going into the meeting so that we can just discuss where we are and not have to click buttons during the meeting.
0:12:4.800 --> 0:12:6.400
Debra Warrington
Ah, I think that is the goal.
0:12:6.850 --> 0:12:8.990
Craig Glazer
Yeah, if that's the goal, we don't have to change.
0:12:6.410 --> 0:12:9.340
Debra Warrington
That will complete a lot of them, yeah.
0:12:9.0 --> 0:12:11.230
Craig Glazer
We don't have to change the format, they just have to clean it up.
0:12:12.640 --> 0:12:20.590
Craig Glazer
And so let's just see what placement looks like, cause I've heard Deb talk about this before and there was essentially 55 like true steps to this.
0:12:23.840 --> 0:12:24.380
Craig Glazer
Interesting.
0:12:29.750 --> 0:12:31.550
Craig Glazer
So this one actually is pretty clean.
0:12:38.770 --> 0:12:42.220
Debra Warrington
And and honestly, we found the DME to be the hardest.
0:12:43.850 --> 0:12:44.30
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:12:42.230 --> 0:12:45.180
Debra Warrington
One of all surprisingly.
0:12:48.730 --> 0:12:51.370
Craig Glazer
And does the to these things happen sequentially?
0:12:54.420 --> 0:13:0.890
Craig Glazer
On this one like does the facility take except the patient medically before all insurance or vice versa?
0:13:1.500 --> 0:13:8.770
Debra Warrington
Yeah, usually because we won't even go with the insurance off if the facilities not gonna accept them.
0:13:8.60 --> 0:13:17.450
Craig Glazer
OK, so we may want to train your team too, if like you haven't gotten to this step yet, to not click anything.
0:13:18.230 --> 0:13:18.460
Debra Warrington
How?
0:13:18.470 --> 0:13:23.60
Debra Warrington
Absolutely, that's exactly how I thought it would go pretty much.
0:13:22.350 --> 0:13:28.240
Craig Glazer
Either that or needs to Cascade Monty that they have to get to complete on one before the next one opens one or the other.
0:13:33.440 --> 0:13:34.370
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah, if they.
0:13:36.680 --> 0:13:41.130
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
What's gonna display there will only be what they have actually answered.
0:13:41.140 --> 0:13:49.600
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So, umm, we can do some cascading logic with some of that we'd have to kinda.
0:13:49.830 --> 0:13:54.80
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
That's kinda sit down with Elma and Deborah to figure out what our triggers would be.
0:13:55.750 --> 0:14:1.650
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
But yeah, if they say we're pending choice and that's where we're at, that's all.
0:14:2.920 --> 0:14:3.160
Craig Glazer
Yeah.
0:14:1.660 --> 0:14:15.530
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
It'll show you know, and then then I can say if the choice is obtained one of these, then I can have these cascade down for them to answer it.
0:14:15.640 --> 0:14:19.700
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So this one would be pretty simple because it's pretty clean with the questions now.
0:14:20.980 --> 0:14:24.790
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Some of these others, especially like dialysis and.
0:14:30.680 --> 0:14:31.840
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Hospice isn't too bad.
0:14:33.350 --> 0:14:34.810
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Home infusions got quite a few.
0:14:36.830 --> 0:14:39.710
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Well, I think the dialysis one is pretty long too.
0:14:42.750 --> 0:14:43.150
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah.
0:14:43.160 --> 0:14:44.540
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Look at 11 questions here.
0:14:45.490 --> 0:14:47.460
Craig Glazer
Yeah, because we definitely do not want to.
0:14:49.660 --> 0:14:52.680
Craig Glazer
Have to see 11 lines.
0:14:54.190 --> 0:14:54.580
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah.
0:14:54.590 --> 0:15:8.430
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So I mean I like with this right here I could just have this here and choice until this is answered with one of these, then let's get cascade down and if this is still pending the facility agency accepting.
0:15:9.750 --> 0:15:12.40
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Ohh well once we click yes.
0:15:15.310 --> 0:15:17.90
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
O then we could cascade down to this.
0:15:19.410 --> 0:15:19.760
Craig Glazer
Right.
0:15:30.370 --> 0:15:33.830
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
And then once that's no longer pending, we can say that it's accepted.
0:15:37.340 --> 0:15:39.920
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
And we could say that the insurance Office still pending.
0:15:43.770 --> 0:15:50.780
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
And then once they do that, we can say that it's no longer pending and it would be complete.
0:15:53.720 --> 0:15:59.160
Craig Glazer
And once it's a complete, it's gonna show up on the as green on the discharge milestone, right?
0:16:0.640 --> 0:16:1.270
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah.
0:16:1.620 --> 0:16:1.860
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:16:17.660 --> 0:16:17.860
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:16:1.840 --> 0:16:20.350
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Once the orders placed for this, it'll create the milestone and then once it's completed down here there is a batch that runs and from my understanding from talking to Chris so it could be a little bit of a delay like 30 minutes but before it actually changes the color when that batch runs and evaluates it.
0:16:21.280 --> 0:16:21.950
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
But yeah, it will.
0:16:22.190 --> 0:16:24.200
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
It'll complete the milestone, the turning green.
0:16:25.370 --> 0:16:25.570
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:16:27.370 --> 0:16:30.600
Debra Warrington
So Monty, well, we have a milestone for each.
0:16:30.950 --> 0:16:33.460
Debra Warrington
Like DME home health.
0:16:37.890 --> 0:16:38.300
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Hi.
0:16:39.40 --> 0:16:40.410
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Don't know.
0:16:40.420 --> 0:16:47.470
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Elma, can you answer that question because she was requesting the different types of milestones and now we were creating one for cardiac rehab.
0:16:48.610 --> 0:16:56.530
Elma Mendes
So, so Monty, can you show that PowerPoint that's just behind this your screen and go to the front?
0:16:56.610 --> 0:16:58.450
Elma Mendes
We have a list of all the milestones there.
0:17:0.540 --> 0:17:2.440
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
At the first of the.
0:17:1.670 --> 0:17:8.110
Elma Mendes
At the the the first, the first slide go to more, yeah, it's maybe it's the third slide.
0:17:12.180 --> 0:17:12.670
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah.
0:17:12.980 --> 0:17:14.430
Elma Mendes
So these are the milestones, yeah.
0:17:13.220 --> 0:17:14.740
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
You want me to creating home, honey?
0:17:26.910 --> 0:17:28.150
Elma Mendes
Did that answer your question, Debra?
0:17:29.410 --> 0:17:29.960
Debra Warrington
Yeah.
0:17:29.970 --> 0:17:36.230
Debra Warrington
So DME will turn green when everything we needed to do to get the DME ready to roll is completed.
0:17:38.440 --> 0:17:38.850
Debra Warrington
That wrote.
0:17:38.300 --> 0:17:39.170
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah, once you.
0:17:41.290 --> 0:17:41.590
Griselda Cardenas
Yeah.
0:17:40.250 --> 0:17:46.430
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Once you choose the completed option for any of those categories.
0:17:47.60 --> 0:17:53.260
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So if we were under the DME, once you complete once you hit that button that says you're complete, that will update the milestone.
0:17:55.610 --> 0:17:57.220
Jennifer Thibodeau
What is the milestone look like?
0:17:57.230 --> 0:17:58.300
Jennifer Thibodeau
If you don't need something.
0:18:0.470 --> 0:18:1.500
Craig Glazer
I think it's just not there.
0:18:2.920 --> 0:18:13.360
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
If not, some of these are just here automatically and I think Chris was going to like reorder some of them.
0:18:13.850 --> 0:18:21.140
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
But yeah it it some of them just don't show until that order is written and then it'll trigger the milestone to be there.
0:18:21.190 --> 0:18:25.80
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So I mean, if we had DME there, we could add it, yeah.
0:18:28.720 --> 0:18:32.110
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
If they're all in here and I don't think they're all in here right now because I don't see them.
0:18:35.50 --> 0:18:35.850
Griselda Cardenas
They are all in there.
0:18:34.80 --> 0:18:36.130
Elma Mendes
So it's the order that's actually going to trigger.
0:18:38.140 --> 0:18:48.50
Jennifer Thibodeau
I'm just thinking of of making sure I'm thinking, you know, interns in July, making sure that we're not missing, that we needed something on, you know, dead leventh hour.
0:18:49.970 --> 0:18:58.400
Jennifer Thibodeau
And so just thinking of if that's still in the workflow that we're talking about it, even if there's something that we need that we've checked the box that we've talked about DME and we don't need anything.
0:19:1.220 --> 0:19:7.350
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah, it it won't show up until the order is written for the DME once.
0:19:7.390 --> 0:19:16.600
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Once that care coordination referral order is written, then choose the DMA from the question on the order it will trigger the milestone to appear.
0:19:23.360 --> 0:19:28.300
Craig Glazer
And money and opened up planned discharge disposition cause I think this is what you're getting at, Jenny.
0:19:35.920 --> 0:19:38.890
Craig Glazer
So if we needed DME, that would be home with needs.
0:19:39.660 --> 0:19:42.40
Craig Glazer
So if we click that now, that's what we want with.
0:19:56.20 --> 0:19:57.630
Craig Glazer
So can you can you do that again?
0:19:57.640 --> 0:19:58.970
Craig Glazer
Except you home with needs.
0:20:7.500 --> 0:20:7.960
Jennifer Thibodeau
Got it.
0:20:8.420 --> 0:20:9.0
Jennifer Thibodeau
OK, perfect.
0:20:5.530 --> 0:20:10.790
Craig Glazer
And then check DME and then whatever it is, right.
0:20:10.800 --> 0:20:12.650
Craig Glazer
So that's, that's where you're gonna see it.
0:20:16.810 --> 0:20:17.300
Jennifer Thibodeau
Got it.
0:20:17.390 --> 0:20:17.820
Jennifer Thibodeau
Perfect.
0:20:17.870 --> 0:20:18.80
Jennifer Thibodeau
OK.
0:20:18.90 --> 0:20:18.390
Jennifer Thibodeau
Thank you.
0:20:12.660 --> 0:20:18.940
Craig Glazer
And then the case manager would be able to say during the meeting we still need our order and then once the orders in.
0:20:20.420 --> 0:20:31.600
Craig Glazer
So because remember, at least in my head, the way the conversations would go would be, you know, let's say we're on hospital Day 10 for Magnolia Z test.
0:20:31.970 --> 0:20:33.430
Craig Glazer
We would say this is her.
0:20:33.440 --> 0:20:35.500
Craig Glazer
She's here with this diagnosis.
0:20:35.850 --> 0:20:49.200
Craig Glazer
Our estimated discharge date was five days ago and our home, our discharge with disposition picture is home with mobility related equipment and then we would go as she aware yes and where are we on getting the equipment.
0:20:59.990 --> 0:21:1.340
Craig Glazer
Does that cover what you were getting at?
0:21:1.670 --> 0:21:2.590
Jennifer Thibodeau
Yep, this looks great.
0:21:16.490 --> 0:21:36.550
Craig Glazer
So Deb, I guess you'll have to train your team since money didn't build your he built your section off a flow sheets that if we do change course and it was gonna start with DME and we've changed our mind and we're now going to placement, they need to clear the DME stuff out, right, make those set lines blank again.
0:21:38.130 --> 0:21:38.710
Debra Warrington
Yeah, hopefully.
0:21:38.180 --> 0:21:40.420
Craig Glazer
Otherwise, that section's gonna get really long.
0:21:41.510 --> 0:21:49.900
Debra Warrington
If I've already been delivered to the home, I mean and, and we do that occasionally, we start down the home path and we order equipment and we get everything ready.
0:21:49.910 --> 0:21:52.100
Debra Warrington
And then all of a sudden, now we're gonna go to skilled.
0:21:56.60 --> 0:21:56.500
Craig Glazer
Right.
0:21:56.540 --> 0:21:59.550
Craig Glazer
So they'll have to clean it out wherever we are, right?
0:22:3.250 --> 0:22:3.610
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Ohh.
0:22:1.520 --> 0:22:5.360
Craig Glazer
Because getting that stuff home is no longer going to be contingent on their discharge.
0:22:7.160 --> 0:22:7.490
Debra Warrington
Correct.
0:22:8.370 --> 0:22:8.540
Craig Glazer
Yeah.
0:22:12.540 --> 0:22:12.750
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:22:13.750 --> 0:22:14.460
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Ohh.
0:22:17.90 --> 0:22:22.590
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
To clear it out though, I would probably have to build them like I've built.
0:22:23.690 --> 0:22:24.970
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
There's a smart forms.
0:22:28.10 --> 0:22:28.570
Elma Mendes
So could we?
0:22:29.770 --> 0:22:33.680
Elma Mendes
Doctor Glazer, I know this might take a little bit longer than expected, but I would like to.
0:22:34.100 --> 0:22:38.580
Elma Mendes
I'm just discuss with Griselda, Monte and Deborah.
0:22:40.110 --> 0:22:54.500
Elma Mendes
Other ideas that we got because when you mentioned to group these I I just had an idea and I was wondering if that would be possible, maybe we could instead of making them into forms, keeping them as flow sheet rows for Debra's people.
0:22:54.510 --> 0:22:54.770
Elma Mendes
People.
0:22:55.890 --> 0:23:2.900
Elma Mendes
Maybe we could consider umm other options as far as what you see that is totally collapsed.
0:23:5.950 --> 0:23:15.80
Elma Mendes
SO11 idea could be maybe to create these banners kind of similar to a banner that is created by the order.
0:23:15.790 --> 0:23:16.50
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:23:15.440 --> 0:23:26.620
Elma Mendes
Maybe we could do that with a flow sheet row and you know have it either green or red or, you know, maybe that might be a better coloring system as far as where we're at.
0:23:27.480 --> 0:23:30.320
Elma Mendes
And then have those buckets that you mentioned the insurance.
0:23:30.610 --> 0:23:38.140
Elma Mendes
I'm paperwork and whatever the the other buckets where we can kind of take a look and see how we can group them.
0:23:41.580 --> 0:23:46.130
Craig Glazer
And yeah, I mean, I'm open to whatever look works and that can be fitted in.
0:23:46.200 --> 0:23:47.210
Craig Glazer
It's fine with me.
0:23:47.220 --> 0:23:47.800
Craig Glazer
I just.
0:23:48.300 --> 0:23:58.520
Craig Glazer
I was just worried that it if it's too long then it it, you know, it's hard to get through in a minute or two per patient, which is what the overall goal is, right? So.
0:24:1.90 --> 0:24:14.60
Debra Warrington
Yeah, we put all those little bitty steps in our process so that anybody taking over that case would know immediately where that care coordinator was in the process because we have a lot of, you know, people out.
0:24:13.700 --> 0:24:14.110
Craig Glazer
Yeah.
0:24:14.120 --> 0:24:18.170
Craig Glazer
No, I can completely see the value of having the flow sheet built that way.
0:24:18.130 --> 0:24:21.840
Debra Warrington
Yes, yes, have dense that.
0:24:18.180 --> 0:24:31.460
Craig Glazer
I'm just trying to figure out how do we how do we group that so that what gets displayed to the team as a whole doesn't have to show every itty bitty step on the way and can just say, you know, we've cleared this hurdle.
0:24:31.470 --> 0:24:35.450
Craig Glazer
We're still waiting on that hurdle and after this hurdle, they're still another one, so.
0:24:36.400 --> 0:24:36.710
Debra Warrington
Yeah.
0:24:40.940 --> 0:24:41.500
Craig Glazer
Exactly.
0:24:36.720 --> 0:24:42.610
Debra Warrington
Just a little sneak peek at where we are in the overall process of each of those categories.
0:24:42.620 --> 0:24:43.560
Debra Warrington
I completely agree.
0:24:48.490 --> 0:24:48.690
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:24:51.270 --> 0:24:55.340
Craig Glazer
So I guess for next time we you guys will take that back and work on that.
0:24:55.430 --> 0:25:0.700
Craig Glazer
And then just from, let's open that Pam family progression to discharge piece.
0:25:6.440 --> 0:25:6.770
Craig Glazer
Sure.
0:25:6.780 --> 0:25:10.120
Craig Glazer
We happy with these questions as they is the question for the group.
0:25:31.670 --> 0:25:33.70
Craig Glazer
Briana gives a thumbs up.
0:25:34.790 --> 0:25:36.550
Craig Glazer
Umm, go ahead.
0:25:35.270 --> 0:25:48.380
Abey Thomas
Uh, I have a question I I have a question should should there be something about whether the family has any transportation arrangement for this patient among these questions?
0:26:3.560 --> 0:26:4.190
Craig Glazer
That what do you think?
0:26:6.270 --> 0:26:24.480
Debra Warrington
You know, we do transportation if it's ambulance, if they're going by family patient, vehicle kind of thing then that is kind of up to the staff nurse to coordinate that with the patient and their family because we don't really.
0:26:25.790 --> 0:26:33.260
Debra Warrington
I mean, we may ask that question up front, but it's not gonna help you here because everybody has a ride in the beginning.
0:26:34.90 --> 0:26:49.700
Debra Warrington
It's in the end that it becomes the issue and by the end I mean we've usually already moved on, but now the patient wants to stay and eat lunch or the daughter can't come till after she gets off work at 5 lots of times.
0:26:49.710 --> 0:26:53.780
Debra Warrington
Those are not the things that we know about, if that makes sense.
0:27:6.130 --> 0:27:12.220
Abey Thomas
I'm just wondering what the best way is for the whole team to know what the transportation arrangements are for each individual patient.
0:27:12.530 --> 0:27:19.240
Abey Thomas
Maybe it's not this section that it should be at, but I mean I'd like to know how what the plan is when the patient leaves.
0:27:19.490 --> 0:27:21.10
Abey Thomas
How is that patient getting home?
0:27:22.800 --> 0:27:22.960
Craig Glazer
Yeah.
0:27:21.880 --> 0:27:25.710
Abey Thomas
Umm, not just for care coordination reason, but in general.
0:27:26.800 --> 0:27:27.430
Debra Warrington
And you know what?
0:27:27.440 --> 0:27:37.850
Debra Warrington
I kind of agree with that for the entire team to know that the patient saying my family is coming to drive me home versus you know.
0:27:39.990 --> 0:27:44.650
Craig Glazer
That's, you know, maybe under go to that plan DC disposition on Monty.
0:27:47.440 --> 0:28:1.730
Craig Glazer
So in in a case like this, if it's home either home without needs or home with needs, would we you would you want something here to say family to provide transportation or we provide transportation or ambulance required or something like that?
0:28:2.950 --> 0:28:5.300
Craig Glazer
Would that do what you're talking about, Abby?
0:28:7.260 --> 0:28:8.50
Abey Thomas
Yeah, it would.
0:28:8.60 --> 0:28:14.800
Abey Thomas
In the end, they just have to reflect somewhere in the in the in the general summary of how the judges will be accomplished.
0:28:14.960 --> 0:28:20.780
Abey Thomas
So everybody knows exactly what that bit of the plan is, because usually there's a little sticky point somewhere there.
0:28:25.550 --> 0:28:28.190
Debra Warrington
So do we want a mode of transport, whether it be?
0:28:29.260 --> 0:28:31.540
Debra Warrington
Umm BLS ambulance.
0:28:33.100 --> 0:28:39.660
Debra Warrington
Wheelchair van versus family provide auto because that would help us to know up front.
0:28:41.170 --> 0:28:43.10
Debra Warrington
We need to have arrange an ambulance.
0:28:47.210 --> 0:28:48.480
Craig Glazer
Go and we're not capture.
0:28:48.490 --> 0:28:49.770
Craig Glazer
Is that any of this in the order?
0:28:53.730 --> 0:28:54.20
Debra Warrington
Uh.
0:28:53.380 --> 0:28:56.520
Craig Glazer
I guess the transport in the order there to have if it's going to be one of the others.
0:28:59.980 --> 0:29:0.220
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:28:57.270 --> 0:29:0.540
Debra Warrington
I don't think we have a transport order, do we, doctor Thomas?
0:29:2.750 --> 0:29:4.750
Abey Thomas
No, there is no particular transfer order.
0:29:5.380 --> 0:29:5.600
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:29:7.290 --> 0:29:7.660
Debra Warrington
App.
0:29:6.990 --> 0:29:14.30
Craig Glazer
I mean, Monty, could, could you do that and put mode of transport for the home and for the home with without needs for both of the home options?
0:29:14.990 --> 0:29:20.90
Craig Glazer
Because I think I feel like it's obvious for when we're placing them somewhere that they're going by ambulance right to.
0:29:25.460 --> 0:29:25.590
Craig Glazer
Yeah.
0:29:21.600 --> 0:29:26.80
Debra Warrington
You can go by private auto to skilled and to inpatient rehab.
0:29:26.470 --> 0:29:30.240
Debra Warrington
We don't, but we could, that's.
0:29:26.390 --> 0:29:35.350
Craig Glazer
To maybe we maybe OK, well, at least on these homes, can we do an add a section to these forms then money, would that work?
0:29:41.530 --> 0:29:41.840
Abey Thomas
Yeah.
0:29:37.120 --> 0:29:43.40
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Sure, we could have a faction if they give me the options to put down there.
0:29:41.850 --> 0:29:43.240
Abey Thomas
Remember, sometimes in a week.
0:29:43.630 --> 0:29:47.470
Abey Thomas
Yes, that they're not patients that might not have a right whatsoever.
0:29:47.480 --> 0:29:55.940
Abey Thomas
They might need, you know, they might need us to give them a voucher or something that, UM, can end up being a last second, still priced.
0:29:55.950 --> 0:29:57.860
Abey Thomas
So we need to have something in place.
0:29:58.600 --> 0:30:0.350
Abey Thomas
Not that that gives us all those options.
0:30:2.820 --> 0:30:3.770
Craig Glazer
Yeah, money said.
0:30:3.780 --> 0:30:5.520
Craig Glazer
If you give them all the options, he can build it so.
0:30:6.490 --> 0:30:21.220
Elma Mendes
So I can I just interject for a second the there is actually the adult patient profile, which is a flow sheet that done nurses document and not just the nurses care coordination or anyone has access to it and there is a transition planning.
0:30:21.430 --> 0:30:26.400
Elma Mendes
So she have a group that has the trans anticipated transportation.
0:30:26.750 --> 0:30:31.180
Elma Mendes
This is what they're already fill out, and I even have a patient example here with a nurse.
0:30:38.170 --> 0:30:39.420
Craig Glazer
Umm before.
0:30:31.190 --> 0:30:42.190
Elma Mendes
Document it on May 20th that this the family or friend will provide transportation at discharge, so that would be something we could add to just be visible.
0:30:42.200 --> 0:30:43.740
Elma Mendes
That kind of documentation.
0:30:42.830 --> 0:30:45.600
Craig Glazer
Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say.
0:30:45.90 --> 0:30:45.950
Abey Thomas
Can be pulled.
0:30:45.610 --> 0:30:46.970
Craig Glazer
Can we can we surface that here?
0:30:50.370 --> 0:30:50.920
Craig Glazer
Sorry, Abby.
0:30:50.990 --> 0:30:51.230
Elma Mendes
So.
0:30:50.930 --> 0:30:51.360
Craig Glazer
What you say?
0:31:8.920 --> 0:31:12.70
Craig Glazer
Abey I missed what you said because I was rudely over talking over you.
0:31:13.970 --> 0:31:15.20
Abey Thomas
Well, I'm so sorry.
0:31:15.30 --> 0:31:18.30
Abey Thomas
I I said, can that be pulled in by any chance?
0:31:18.40 --> 0:31:20.0
Abey Thomas
So reduces you know manual.
0:31:27.410 --> 0:31:27.790
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I mean.
0:31:26.530 --> 0:31:29.280
Craig Glazer
Sir Elma and Monty, we could probably pull that in somewhere, right?
0:31:30.530 --> 0:31:31.200
Elma Mendes
Yeah, and it would be.
0:31:30.690 --> 0:31:31.750
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah, I mean, I can.
0:31:32.820 --> 0:31:38.890
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I can have a section in here right after family progression that shows transportation.
0:31:39.820 --> 0:31:44.990
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I can display the value of that Flowsheet entry that almost talking about.
0:31:45.420 --> 0:31:51.180
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
We can even make it interactive as well, so that you can update it if you need to update it if it hasn't been filled out.
0:31:51.830 --> 0:31:52.10
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:31:54.60 --> 0:31:54.430
Elma Mendes
So the.
0:31:53.900 --> 0:31:55.290
Craig Glazer
Sounds like we were sure.
0:31:55.300 --> 0:31:55.710
Craig Glazer
Go ahead.
0:31:55.760 --> 0:31:56.310
Craig Glazer
Sorry, hammer.
0:31:56.610 --> 0:31:57.880
Elma Mendes
So there is one more.
0:31:57.890 --> 0:32:9.390
Elma Mendes
There's also transportation concern whether they have no car or need a public transport, so there's actually two flow sheet rows that we could add to that just to address transportation.
0:32:7.590 --> 0:32:10.720
Craig Glazer
Perfect. Perfect.
0:32:15.380 --> 0:32:20.960
Craig Glazer
Alright, so money, can you open that plan dispo and progression and show us those family questions again?
0:32:25.650 --> 0:32:32.180
Craig Glazer
What I was wondering is like should that first question be does family agree with plan disposition?
0:32:34.20 --> 0:32:38.390
Craig Glazer
This family agree with expected discharge date or is there?
0:32:38.400 --> 0:32:40.270
Craig Glazer
Are they aware of and degree?
0:32:43.460 --> 0:32:46.690
Craig Glazer
I don't know if that's necessary or not, but I could see a family saying.
0:32:46.700 --> 0:32:48.970
Craig Glazer
Ohh yeah, I know you wanna send them home, but hell no.
0:32:49.500 --> 0:32:50.40
Craig Glazer
Right.
0:32:50.120 --> 0:32:51.130
Craig Glazer
And then we're still not.
0:32:52.650 --> 0:32:56.530
Craig Glazer
We're all operating under the assumption that we're good, but the families actually not good.
0:32:56.540 --> 0:32:57.610
Craig Glazer
That's the reason I bring it up.
0:32:59.440 --> 0:33:3.100
Debra Warrington
I like the agree word too, because you're exactly right.
0:33:7.660 --> 0:33:10.320
Debra Warrington
Aware is one thing, agreeing to it as a whole nother thing.
0:33:25.280 --> 0:33:27.650
Craig Glazer
Anyone else want to make that change to the wording?
0:33:36.690 --> 0:33:36.910
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:33:38.650 --> 0:33:42.710
Craig Glazer
Yeah, I got one thumbs up and a lot of people not voting up.
0:33:42.720 --> 0:33:43.300
Craig Glazer
Two thumbs up.
0:33:45.750 --> 0:33:48.740
Craig Glazer
Three and you thumbs down.
0:33:48.850 --> 0:33:50.590
Craig Glazer
Speak now or forever hold your peace, right?
0:33:51.720 --> 0:33:57.90
Jennifer Thibodeau
What is the finally ready for discharge if if we have agreed, do we need that one still?
0:34:0.460 --> 0:34:0.980
Craig Glazer
Good question.
0:34:0.640 --> 0:34:2.20
Jennifer Thibodeau
My mind that was kind of the agree.
0:34:3.160 --> 0:34:3.550
Craig Glazer
I see.
0:34:5.920 --> 0:34:7.640
Jennifer Thibodeau
But if we put agree, maybe we don't need that one.
0:34:13.300 --> 0:34:13.580
Jennifer Thibodeau
That.
0:34:12.990 --> 0:34:15.60
Craig Glazer
Deb, do you know what we're getting at with that one? Is there?
0:34:15.70 --> 0:34:16.90
Craig Glazer
Is that something different?
0:34:22.600 --> 0:34:23.910
Debra Warrington
Let me let me look at it again.
0:34:26.580 --> 0:34:30.900
Craig Glazer
This is assuming we're saying they agree with the disposition and they agree with the discharge date.
0:34:39.590 --> 0:34:47.710
Debra Warrington
Yeah, I think if you have the discharge day, you don't need is the family just the family agree to discharge.
0:34:47.900 --> 0:34:50.760
Debra Warrington
Hopefully you've already covered it in that previous question.
0:34:51.520 --> 0:34:51.780
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:35:1.530 --> 0:35:8.140
Craig Glazer
So money, I guess that would mean we would change the first one to his patient and family, this patient and family agree with planned disposition.
0:35:8.490 --> 0:35:12.920
Craig Glazer
Second one is, does patient and family agree with expected discharge date?
0:35:13.270 --> 0:35:17.560
Craig Glazer
Get rid of the third question and then leave the the others.
0:35:22.900 --> 0:35:26.350
Jennifer Thibodeau
What would if the patient did not agree?
0:35:28.0 --> 0:35:31.270
Jennifer Thibodeau
Is there another option besides appealing the discharge?
0:35:39.490 --> 0:35:45.190
Debra Warrington
We can relook at disposition is are they disagreeing cause now they wanna go to skilled or?
0:35:47.230 --> 0:35:54.140
Debra Warrington
Oh, but usually if they're just disagreeing to disagreeing, then we try to force them into appeal.
0:35:54.210 --> 0:36:0.340
Debra Warrington
If their Medicare, which granted gives them two days of stay, but it gets us off of high center.
0:36:10.490 --> 0:36:12.530
Jennifer Thibodeau
I don't know what a cover letter is.
0:36:15.700 --> 0:36:22.570
Debra Warrington
When the patient files that they want that they are disagreeing with their discharge, they think they're being discharged prematurely.
0:36:22.880 --> 0:36:23.660
Jennifer Thibodeau
Then they get down.
0:36:27.520 --> 0:36:27.900
Jennifer Thibodeau
Yep.
0:36:22.900 --> 0:36:31.570
Debra Warrington
Then they have to they make a call to keep pro and then Kepro sends us a letter that verifies the patient indeed has filed an appeal.
0:36:32.0 --> 0:36:37.860
Debra Warrington
If we don't get the letter and then usually that patients telling us they're going to appeal, they just don't.
0:36:40.150 --> 0:36:48.680
Debra Warrington
And if that happens, we go ahead and issue the hit in Ann Ladder, letting them know they're going to be responsible for their charges if they don't discharge.
0:36:49.350 --> 0:36:49.590
Jennifer Thibodeau
OK.
0:36:49.230 --> 0:36:53.570
Debra Warrington
And then if they go ahead and appeal, then we cancel that hand letter at that time.
0:37:2.320 --> 0:37:2.480
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:37:7.520 --> 0:37:8.30
Craig Glazer
Alright.
0:37:8.620 --> 0:37:10.560
Craig Glazer
Any other comments for these questions?
0:37:14.600 --> 0:37:14.980
Craig Glazer
Alright.
0:37:14.990 --> 0:37:21.760
Craig Glazer
And then let's just look at that medical progress to DC thing and make sure we're not, we all agree that that's all we need to capture.
0:37:38.250 --> 0:37:42.520
Craig Glazer
Yeah, you have a spelling error on the procedures on the the bottom part.
0:37:42.530 --> 0:37:45.950
Craig Glazer
It should be trach change, not tack change.
0:37:50.410 --> 0:37:58.140
Craig Glazer
And now so it said it should say no procedure pending and it says at this there's a spelling error there too. Yep.
0:38:1.190 --> 0:38:2.620
Craig Glazer
Do you guys think we need anything else here?
0:38:20.480 --> 0:38:21.400
Lynne Howsley
We had Gronk.
0:38:26.430 --> 0:38:26.710
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:38:26.550 --> 0:38:31.500
Lynne Howsley
Or is that just that lung transplants that need that?
0:38:32.270 --> 0:38:33.660
Debra Warrington
Yep, for those longs for sure.
0:38:35.40 --> 0:38:36.320
Craig Glazer
Yeah, we can add.
0:38:36.560 --> 0:38:37.930
Craig Glazer
Do you ever have problems with it?
0:38:37.930 --> 0:38:41.460
Craig Glazer
And endoscopy, we're waiting on an endoscopy before discharge.
0:38:48.110 --> 0:38:51.120
Craig Glazer
Now that's shocking.
0:38:50.370 --> 0:38:51.400
Debra Warrington
Not that I can thank you.
0:38:52.80 --> 0:38:52.450
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:38:52.460 --> 0:38:53.150
Craig Glazer
All right.
0:38:53.380 --> 0:38:58.440
Craig Glazer
Well, let's uh under procedures, then add bronchoscopy as a possible.
0:38:59.710 --> 0:39:4.240
Craig Glazer
I kind of think that medically stable for discharge today should be at the top of that section.
0:39:13.110 --> 0:39:22.400
Craig Glazer
And maybe we should default that to know so that people get reminded they're supposed to answer that and change it to yes, when it's yes, I don't.
0:39:22.410 --> 0:39:23.100
Craig Glazer
What do you guys think?
0:39:28.920 --> 0:39:30.970
Briana Witherspoon
I definitely think moving it to the top is helpful.
0:39:31.250 --> 0:39:34.730
Briana Witherspoon
I'm in different about the hard or automatically making it.
0:39:34.740 --> 0:39:35.690
Briana Witherspoon
Are the default being no.
0:39:36.290 --> 0:39:36.550
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:39:39.690 --> 0:39:40.450
Jennifer Thibodeau
I was still thinking.
0:39:39.700 --> 0:39:41.610
Debra Warrington
Do we need the word today?
0:39:41.620 --> 0:39:42.80
Debra Warrington
I'm sorry.
0:39:42.910 --> 0:39:43.210
Jennifer Thibodeau
Go ahead.
0:39:43.960 --> 0:39:47.280
Debra Warrington
Do we need the word to day on it or do we just want to indicate yes?
0:39:56.850 --> 0:39:59.430
Craig Glazer
I would think we just need to, we don't need the word today.
0:40:2.920 --> 0:40:4.460
Abey Thomas
I second that yes, yes.
0:40:2.610 --> 0:40:4.650
Craig Glazer
It seems implied to me, yeah.
0:40:9.630 --> 0:40:13.590
Briana Witherspoon
Also, Monty Medically is is spelled wrong on that question.
0:40:20.970 --> 0:40:21.510
Craig Glazer
Go ahead, Jenny.
0:40:22.160 --> 0:40:30.410
Jennifer Thibodeau
I was thinking about the endoscopy, colonoscopy and we do sometimes wait for that, particularly if it's we we know we need it on a Friday.
0:40:35.620 --> 0:40:35.860
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:40:30.600 --> 0:40:37.420
Jennifer Thibodeau
Sometimes that does lay us over the weekend, so I don't know if that we do wanna add that in a for for trying to track everything.
0:40:38.160 --> 0:40:41.650
Craig Glazer
Alright, what about cardiac procedures like Cath or something?
0:40:41.660 --> 0:40:43.120
Craig Glazer
Does that ever get in the way of a discharge?
0:40:45.770 --> 0:40:46.250
Jennifer Thibodeau
Umm.
0:40:48.620 --> 0:40:51.190
Jennifer Thibodeau
Not from me, because the urgent things from biopsy.
0:40:51.200 --> 0:40:51.610
Jennifer Thibodeau
But I am.
0:40:51.620 --> 0:40:54.510
Jennifer Thibodeau
I could see that it might maybe from general cardiology standpoint.
0:40:57.110 --> 0:41:0.580
Craig Glazer
OK, Abby, you ever had one at the discharge?
0:41:0.590 --> 0:41:1.500
Craig Glazer
Delayed for a calf.
0:41:11.100 --> 0:41:11.420
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:41:12.150 --> 0:41:24.930
Craig Glazer
I would do one lot would be bronchoscopy and other line would be endoscopy slash colonoscopy remote and if we end up picking something else up on the other regularly we we can always go back and add it.
0:41:28.150 --> 0:41:32.450
Jennifer Thibodeau
There is another so we can, if we start capturing a lot of the things and others we can make them their own little.
0:41:33.120 --> 0:41:33.540
Craig Glazer
Yeah.
0:41:34.960 --> 0:41:42.130
Craig Glazer
The other thing that I'll just warn everyone that a lot of times we see that people start using the others so they don't have to look at the list.
0:41:42.140 --> 0:41:47.80
Craig Glazer
So if we start seeing that sometimes you have to go back and remove the other, enforce people to use the list.
0:41:48.520 --> 0:41:52.0
Craig Glazer
And what are we getting at with discharge delays extended stay?
0:42:3.630 --> 0:42:3.950
Debra Warrington
I think.
0:42:3.450 --> 0:42:20.390
Robin Novakovic
Craig, do we have a a place where we can record if the length of stay is delayed because we're waiting for insurance approval, acceptance from the receiving facility, Umm PM and R to come see?
0:42:20.400 --> 0:42:25.330
Robin Novakovic
And I'm sorry I've been in the ICU managing something, so I missed some of you.
0:42:24.470 --> 0:42:25.800
Craig Glazer
Yeah, no worries.
0:42:25.810 --> 0:42:30.110
Craig Glazer
I mean, I'll tell you what in my head is the answer to that.
0:42:30.120 --> 0:42:37.410
Craig Glazer
And then Elma and Monty can tell me if we're correct, but I think we should have time stamps for everything in those flow sheets.
0:42:38.710 --> 0:42:51.520
Craig Glazer
So if we said patients medically stable for discharge and they don't go home, we should be able to look and see what discharge milestones are we waiting on and then be able to track that.
0:42:51.530 --> 0:42:55.860
Craig Glazer
At least that's the way it was working in my head and we didn't have to manually select that.
0:42:55.870 --> 0:42:59.770
Craig Glazer
But Elma and Monty, please tell me if I'm wrong on that.
0:43:8.400 --> 0:43:8.900
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Excuse me?
0:43:8.910 --> 0:43:12.800
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
No, the a Flowsheet Rd does have a times down, yeah.
0:43:16.380 --> 0:43:28.150
Craig Glazer
So we'll be able to go back and theoretically run reports and say, all right, if medically stable is, yes, you know, what, are we still pending on and then be able to answer that question, right.
0:43:29.560 --> 0:43:30.100
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah.
0:43:30.110 --> 0:43:30.290
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
No.
0:43:35.780 --> 0:43:38.780
Craig Glazer
We don't need to display, you just need to behind the scenes.
0:43:30.300 --> 0:43:42.130
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So the this is a smart formula I I don't know if I can make the timestamp display like I can for a flow sheet but it's yeah yeah it does have a time stamp on it.
0:43:47.780 --> 0:43:51.650
Craig Glazer
So with Robin's clarifying question, then do we need that next question there?
0:44:3.620 --> 0:44:26.520
Robin Novakovic
I guess it would be helpful if you were trying to identify what delays if someone wants to help identify what the delay is from if they feel it is, you know, maybe it's multiple things going on, but they think one is particularly egregious like in Azure insurance approval.
0:44:26.530 --> 0:44:28.480
Robin Novakovic
Family hasn't made a decision.
0:44:28.490 --> 0:44:30.980
Robin Novakovic
Family refuses refusal.
0:44:34.450 --> 0:44:34.770
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:44:40.580 --> 0:44:52.130
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Well, but that kind of goes back to it's and I and now we looked at this at one point, but I don't remember what we were gonna have discussions over.
0:44:53.210 --> 0:44:57.90
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
There are delays as part of the milestones.
0:44:58.270 --> 0:45:6.310
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Umm so for like waiting on the family's ride or waiting for test results.
0:45:6.320 --> 0:45:12.360
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Cath, I mean, these are some things that are here, but I think it needs to kind of probably be cleaned up O.
0:45:16.220 --> 0:45:23.660
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
And those would show here under your milestone so that you would have it at a glance right here with your milestones.
0:45:34.150 --> 0:45:35.360
Craig Glazer
I mean, that's kind of nice.
0:45:35.370 --> 0:45:39.990
Craig Glazer
I think I think we'd have to, Dave.
0:45:40.0 --> 0:45:49.220
Craig Glazer
I think since your teams gonna would own that, we would want to educate them that would they wouldn't wanna start selecting these things if the patient wasn't medically ready for discharge.
0:45:51.200 --> 0:46:1.120
Craig Glazer
But if they are, I think that's that kinda they'll make a data pull later, easier and it helps the team have a quick OK, This is why we're still stuck, right.
0:46:7.120 --> 0:46:8.990
Debra Warrington
Yes, because it could be.
0:46:9.580 --> 0:46:27.300
Debra Warrington
The patient doesn't have insurance and we can't get anybody to accept them or they've got OI in the Medicaid and Molina doesn't approve skilled nursing or just trying to think of other things that makes the stay extended, but it's at no fault of anyone.
0:46:36.330 --> 0:46:41.880
Craig Glazer
Yeah, I think we should look at it as just data and not worry about did someone do something right or wrong.
0:46:41.890 --> 0:46:46.900
Craig Glazer
So yeah, we'll capture some things that we can intervene on like they just don't have insurance.
0:46:48.810 --> 0:46:49.120
Debra Warrington
Right.
0:46:46.910 --> 0:46:52.930
Craig Glazer
So they have no placement option, but you know that's OK as long as we're just capturing the reasons.
0:46:52.940 --> 0:47:8.420
Craig Glazer
And then we'll just be at least be able to know that like, hey, 30% of our you know, really long length of stays are due to insurance would they don't have insurance versus the 10% that are due to I am not putting in pegs or whatever it is right, so.
0:47:11.240 --> 0:47:11.540
Debra Warrington
Right.
0:47:11.320 --> 0:47:12.630
Craig Glazer
I think that's that's helpful.
0:47:12.640 --> 0:47:24.500
Craig Glazer
So maybe I don't think we have to wait till launch for that, but maybe at some point you can look at those delay reasons and see.
0:47:26.860 --> 0:47:32.350
Craig Glazer
And I mean, I think money is right like like some of those that stuff is like what's delaying us for two hours?
0:47:32.360 --> 0:47:38.530
Craig Glazer
And I don't know if there's really value add in that stuff, but we wanna make sure we have a list of options for the things that.
0:47:41.80 --> 0:47:42.670
Craig Glazer
Are leading to longer delays.
0:47:45.700 --> 0:48:6.410
Abey Thomas
You know, just just mentioning because we weren't in the project for about a year or almost two years where we were looking at the delays, we were manually trying to get a lot of that data off of two floors, something like this would have been invaluable when it came to wrapping our minds around it.
0:48:6.790 --> 0:48:8.70
Abey Thomas
Now this for sure.
0:48:8.860 --> 0:48:14.920
Abey Thomas
Anything that we can get out of this project would definitely help us add to what we already knew from that project.
0:48:18.0 --> 0:48:27.870
Craig Glazer
Yeah, I mean I I totally agree abey in you know the the medical literature on these types of rounds are if you do the rounds, it's great, but you can't prove that it's gonna affect lengths of stay.
0:48:27.940 --> 0:48:37.950
Craig Glazer
But when you layer in the electronic two like this and data collection so that you could go after systemic issues, that's when you start to see pretty dramatic improvements in lengths of stay.
0:48:37.960 --> 0:48:54.40
Craig Glazer
So I do think that's a crucial piece of the project that you know, once we get this tool built and we're working on training and the back end of this, we can start working on building reports and stuff so that we can start collating that data and coming up with improvement projects.
0:49:13.780 --> 0:49:14.610
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I felt.
0:49:4.850 --> 0:49:14.930
Craig Glazer
And Monty, I guess we we haven't overcome the avoidable day question yet like had it had surfaced that.
0:49:16.990 --> 0:49:19.360
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I don't think that we have.
0:49:19.370 --> 0:49:27.640
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I mean that's that's under, you know, the bed days, this patient doesn't have a all served on it.
0:49:27.650 --> 0:49:29.930
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Let me see if I can see if this one does.
0:49:34.880 --> 0:49:36.450
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
No, that one doesn't either.
0:49:36.530 --> 0:49:36.940
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
That's good.
0:49:36.950 --> 0:49:37.590
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
That's on that.
0:49:46.380 --> 0:49:50.370
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah, there's no officer, but it's it's under there.
0:49:50.380 --> 0:49:52.910
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Let me see if I can find a patient that's actually got some.
0:50:0.930 --> 0:50:1.260
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
OK.
0:50:1.270 --> 0:50:1.990
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Thank is, Craig.
0:50:2.100 --> 0:50:2.700
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I'll start.
0:50:12.160 --> 0:50:15.450
Craig Glazer
So epics doing this off of authorized days.
0:50:17.450 --> 0:50:19.330
Craig Glazer
Judging from where you're going, is that right?
0:50:21.520 --> 0:50:32.820
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Well, the officer center, you know, kind of have this thing first for referral and you're getting authorization through insurance as part of this tool.
0:50:33.490 --> 0:50:52.390
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
But the bad days are located inside that, but I've I've just made it where if you're on that patient and you're in the transition of care and you wanna do that, I mean, you just go to the bed days and update them and without having to go into that tool.
0:50:54.20 --> 0:51:5.780
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
But the part of what utilization management should be doing is putting in the approved nights as they're getting continued stay approval and we've got avoidable nights and the night nights.
0:51:9.620 --> 0:51:12.810
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I think somebody had wanted to go in and clean up these reasons.
0:51:12.820 --> 0:51:15.490
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
We did it one time before cause we separated it.
0:51:15.500 --> 0:51:30.810
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
With what care coordination management would put in versus what you realization management would put in ohm, but I don't think we went too much further with it after we created this list.
0:51:33.980 --> 0:51:39.370
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I know that you mention management does put in some avoidable nights.
0:51:39.380 --> 0:51:42.150
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I'm not sure how often care coordination is doing, but it was.
0:51:42.240 --> 0:51:46.950
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
It was designed that way so that when you umm came in here, they could type UM and they could just get right to their list.
0:51:47.420 --> 0:51:51.280
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
And these are the list, the things that you can management that they wanted to be able to.
0:51:52.340 --> 0:52:1.610
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Document so I know you M is putting these in because they're running a report off of the avoidable dice that they take to leadership and governance.
0:52:7.410 --> 0:52:12.720
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
And they're typically doing on putting in a start date, you know, and an end date for that avoidable day.
0:52:14.280 --> 0:52:16.200
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
And then lifting with that was.
0:52:20.940 --> 0:52:21.270
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:52:20.750 --> 0:52:23.60
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
They can't associate a provider with it as well.
0:52:27.380 --> 0:52:28.150
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I will come out.
0:52:32.840 --> 0:52:45.290
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So humanization management is putting these on as far as from a case management perspective, I don't know how often the case managers are putting these side, but we do have a list here.
0:52:45.300 --> 0:52:52.250
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
He's probably just wanna clean it up, make sure we're recording what we want to for this project.
0:52:55.930 --> 0:52:56.150
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:52:56.850 --> 0:53:5.310
Debra Warrington
We do enter delays is probably not as consistent as it could be because you have to leave for your charting and go into another tab to get to it.
0:53:5.610 --> 0:53:9.790
Debra Warrington
So it's not something that's you see obvious?
0:53:22.110 --> 0:53:25.270
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
So yeah, I mean, even here we have like LTAC no bad.
0:53:29.620 --> 0:53:44.80
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
But the way we were to thought, we were defining a delay when we, when we recorded that delay was they should have been out of here at 9:00 o'clock this morning.
0:53:44.90 --> 0:53:45.640
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
But we're not getting the matta here till 6:00.
0:53:45.650 --> 0:53:51.120
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
O'clock in the evening, they avoidable night means they were here.
0:53:51.130 --> 0:53:55.250
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
We should have gotten them out today, but we've now crossed over at midnight and they're still here.
0:53:56.430 --> 0:53:56.620
Craig Glazer
I see.
0:53:59.910 --> 0:54:0.170
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:54:3.830 --> 0:54:6.620
Debra Warrington
Yeah, ones before the discharge order gets written.
0:54:6.630 --> 0:54:12.980
Debra Warrington
That's what prevents the discharge order from being written and the other one is after the discharge order has written been written.
0:54:13.210 --> 0:54:14.80
Debra Warrington
What are the delays?
0:54:14.910 --> 0:54:15.190
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:54:17.670 --> 0:54:18.940
Craig Glazer
But it's manual, right?
0:54:18.950 --> 0:54:22.280
Craig Glazer
There's no way to automate that based on some of this other stuff we're doing.
0:54:22.290 --> 0:54:22.960
Craig Glazer
Is that right Monty?
0:54:24.390 --> 0:54:25.440
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
That's correct.
0:54:26.40 --> 0:54:26.220
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:54:25.450 --> 0:54:31.480
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I've checked in to see if there's some way to automate those avoidable days and nights.
0:54:31.820 --> 0:54:32.20
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:54:32.350 --> 0:54:33.580
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Currently there's not.
0:54:33.590 --> 0:54:37.560
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
I have put in an enhancement request so that some of that can be triggered by.
0:54:37.570 --> 0:54:47.480
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Maybe you know if we put on a a mile, if we put in a delay here and then crossover midnight, why can't it automatically do an avoidable night for that, you know.
0:54:47.780 --> 0:54:48.460
Craig Glazer
That makes sense.
0:54:51.10 --> 0:54:51.560
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:54:51.610 --> 0:54:55.550
Craig Glazer
So we should just not worry about it then and just try to capture it in these delays.
0:54:55.560 --> 0:54:58.0
Craig Glazer
So we're just about at time.
0:54:58.10 --> 0:55:3.800
Craig Glazer
So it sounds like next steps is to look at that care coordination progression section.
0:55:4.290 --> 0:55:20.110
Craig Glazer
Start with how to group all of those steps so that we can capture the care management piece, but only display the the kind of the group so that everyone's workflow is is optimized and look at other ways to display it.
0:55:20.120 --> 0:55:24.660
Craig Glazer
Because I'm I had some ideas on how to show that different. Umm.
0:55:26.620 --> 0:55:37.630
Craig Glazer
And I I think if we could accomplish that and see it by our next meeting in a couple weeks, which I don't know if how big of an athlete is or not, then we would probably be able to start planning training at that point.
0:55:37.840 --> 0:55:41.660
Craig Glazer
And while we're planning training, we can do some of this other littler stuff.
0:55:42.640 --> 0:55:44.140
Craig Glazer
Does that sound fair to everyone?
0:55:48.160 --> 0:55:48.340
Debra Warrington
Sure.
0:55:48.890 --> 0:55:49.30
Jennifer Thibodeau
Yeah.
0:55:49.410 --> 0:55:49.690
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
But.
0:55:50.400 --> 0:55:50.510
Abey Thomas
Yes.
0:55:55.150 --> 0:55:56.520
Craig Glazer
Marilyn, was that you raising your?
0:55:56.530 --> 0:55:59.600
Craig Glazer
OK, I it's like I say, where do you risk here or not?
0:55:58.580 --> 0:55:59.620
Marilyn Pitts
It was my bad.
0:56:3.20 --> 0:56:3.260
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:56:4.250 --> 0:56:8.930
Craig Glazer
And Elma and Monte, do you have any idea if if two weeks is feasible for a turn around on that?
0:56:13.20 --> 0:56:17.550
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
It depends upon what elma's ideas are. Umm.
0:56:19.560 --> 0:56:19.750
Craig Glazer
OK.
0:56:22.510 --> 0:56:22.860
Evan Galt
We can.
0:56:22.540 --> 0:56:22.900
Craig Glazer
Alright.
0:56:22.870 --> 0:56:23.970
Evan Galt
We'll be in touch next week.
0:56:25.370 --> 0:56:26.110
Craig Glazer
Sounds good.
0:56:25.270 --> 0:56:27.390
Evan Galt
We can, uh figured out.
0:56:28.520 --> 0:56:35.50
Craig Glazer
And then the only other thing was to add that transport stuff as a banner and pull in those two rows from the other flow sheet.
0:56:36.500 --> 0:56:36.700
9c314232-9904-4edd-a07e-10efb1824202
Yeah.
0:56:39.350 --> 0:56:39.830
Craig Glazer
Great.
0:56:40.310 --> 0:56:40.620
Craig Glazer
All right.
0:56:41.760 --> 0:56:42.630
Craig Glazer
Well, thanks everyone.
